It's important to note that significant weight loss with only 3 minutes of exercise per session is highly unlikely.  While some activity is better than none, to see real results, a longer duration and/or increased intensity, along with dietary changes, are necessary.  This plan focuses on maximizing the benefit within the given 3-minute constraint, and it's strongly recommended to increase the duration as your fitness improves.

**Workout Plan (3 minutes per session, Beginner, Weight Loss, Strength Focus, No Equipment)**

This plan focuses on compound bodyweight exercises to maximize calorie burn and muscle engagement in the short timeframe.  Focus on proper form over speed.  As you get stronger, try to increase the number of repetitions you can do within the 3 minutes.


**Day 1: Lower Body & Core**

* **Squats:** 30 seconds. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lower your hips as if sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and chest up.
* **Rest:** 15 seconds.
* **Lunges (alternating legs):** 30 seconds. Step forward with one leg, bending both knees to 90 degrees. Alternate legs.
* **Rest:** 15 seconds.

* **Rest:** 15 seconds. 


**Day 2: Upper Body & Core**

* **Incline Push-ups (against a wall or elevated surface):** 30 seconds.  Perform push-ups against a wall or sturdy surface at an incline. This makes them easier for beginners.
* **Rest:** 15 seconds.

* **Rest:** 15 seconds.

**Day 4: Rest**

**Day 5: Repeat Day 1**

**Day 6: Repeat Day 2**

**Day 7: Repeat Day 3**


**Important Considerations:**

* **Warm-up:**  Before each workout, do a very brief warm-up (e.g., arm circles, leg swings, torso twists) for about 30 seconds.  
* **Cool-down:** After each workout, cool down with some light stretching for 30 seconds (holding each stretch for 15-20 seconds).
* **Progression:**  As you get stronger, try to increase the number of repetitions you can complete within the 30-second intervals. You can also decrease the rest periods.  The ultimate goal should be to gradually increase your workout duration.
* **Nutrition:**  Weight loss is primarily achieved through a calorie deficit (consuming fewer calories than you burn).  Combine this exercise plan with a healthy, balanced diet for best results.
* **Listen to your body:**  If you feel any pain, stop the exercise and consult with a healthcare professional.


This plan is a starting point.  Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress.  As you get fitter, consider increasing the duration and intensity of your workouts for better results.  It's highly recommended to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week for significant weight loss and health benefits.
